    <p>What is truth? It seems like a straightforward question, but the answer depends entirely on how you approach it. Jordan Peterson proposes that truth can be understood in two fundamentally different ways: the Newtonian sense and the Darwinian sense. Understanding both frameworks reveals something profound about how humans have survived and thrived for millennia.</p>

    <h2>Newtonian Truth: The Objective Reality</h2>
    
    <p>The Newtonian sense of truth refers to measurable, material, objective reality—a truth that exists "out there," independent of our perception. This is "Capital T" Truth. Science operates under this framework, seeking universal laws and concrete facts about the physical world.</p>
    
    <p>Richard Dawkins exemplifies this type of thinking. His post-Enlightenment view of religion assumes that religious texts should be read literally, as factual claims about physical reality. While some believers do interpret scripture this way (consider those who view dinosaur fossils as tests of faith), many do not.</p>
    
    <p>Because modern society privileges science and rationality, most of us are raised within a Newtonian framework. This leads to implicit beliefs like "eventually science will figure out all the laws of the Universe." There's nothing wrong with believing this—but it's worth considering that we might not, forever and ever.</p>

    <h2>Darwinian Truth: What Works for Survival</h2>
    
    <p>Peterson challenges the primacy of rationality by asking a simple question: If rational thought has only been dominant for the last 400 years, how did humans survive for the thousands of years before the Enlightenment?</p>
    
    <p>This question points to the Darwinian sense of truth. In this framework, there is no absolute truth—only what is "true enough." True enough for what? For survival.</p>
    
    <p>Peterson argues that rationality is powerful but partial. It's one form of truth, not the only form. The Darwinian sense encompasses a different kind of wisdom: evolved knowledge about action that supports the survival of individuals and species.</p>

    <h2>Religion as Evolved Knowledge About Action</h2>
    
    <p>This brings us to religion, which Peterson views as truth in the Darwinian sense. Religious texts contain evolved knowledge about action—accumulated wisdom about how to behave in ways that promote survival.</p>
    
    <p>Consider a simple example: dietary laws in religious texts. Ancient peoples observed that certain practices (like not defecating where you eat) prevented illness and death. These observations became rules, then sacred laws, ensuring the knowledge would be preserved and followed. This is "knowledge about action."</p>
    
    <p>But what makes it "evolved" knowledge? To understand this, we need to trace how such wisdom develops over evolutionary time, from simple creatures to complex human societies.</p>

    <h2>How Dominance Hierarchies Emerge</h2>
    
    <p>Animals of the same species living together must organize themselves to increase their chances of survival. This creates dominance hierarchies—systems of roles and behavioral patterns that dictate what creatures must do to succeed within their social structure.</p>
    
    <p>Creatures can adapt to these hierarchies by observing successful patterns, internalizing them, and modeling them. From these patterns, rules emerge. Ethics emerges.</p>

    <h2>From Simple Hierarchies to Morality</h2>
    
    <p>In complex species capable of cooperative hunting and caregiving, survival requires more sophisticated behavioral patterns. Consider wolf packs: the alpha wolf isn't simply the toughest fighter. To stay on top, a wolf must be able to defeat rivals without destroying them—otherwise it risks becoming a lone wolf with drastically reduced survival chances.</p>
    
    <p>This is a moral rule coded into behavior. Wolves don't consciously follow ethical principles, but they act as if they do. The wolf that succeeds across multiple dimensions—strength, restraint, social intelligence—becomes the archetypal wolf.</p>
    
    <p>Primatologist Frans de Waal's research on chimpanzees reveals even greater complexity. The chimps who maintain dominance longest aren't just powerful; they build coalitions and recognize that all members of the group have value. Even defeated rivals remain valuable parts of the social structure. Here we see the emergence of human-like ethics.</p>

    <h2>Human Hierarchies and Creativity</h2>
    
    <p>What makes humans successful in dominance hierarchies? We need the same qualities as chimps—power, social intelligence, coalition-building—but with one crucial addition: humans can create new dominance hierarchies. This is what creativity is.</p>
    
    <p>Success in human hierarchies involves the capacity to transform the hierarchy itself. This leads to a profound insight: the top of any single hierarchy is good, but the top of all potential hierarchies is better. The meta-skill of being able to navigate and create new structures becomes paramount.</p>

    <h2>From Observation to Myth</h2>
    
    <p>Humans gain advantages by watching and imitating successful individuals. We model their behavior, which is a form of representation. Because survival depends on learning from success, we find successful people fascinating. We tell stories about them.</p>
    
    <p>These stories are told and retold over centuries. They intermingle and compete until what remains is a synthesis—a collection of the best, most survival-promoting elements from countless narratives. The resulting stories illustrate the optimal traits of successful individuals across time. This is where the concept of the savior begins to emerge.</p>
    
    <p>Egyptian gods and their myths describe the forces that drive dominance hierarchies. As these myths evolved, they gave rise to the religious stories and archetypes we recognize today. This is how religion becomes evolved knowledge about action—wisdom refined over millennia about how to live and thrive.</p>

    <h2>The Spooky Beauty of It All</h2>
    
    <p>Understanding truth in the Darwinian sense reveals something both unsettling and beautiful. As one scholar puts it, "the evolution of human religion is inseparable from the ever-increasing sociality of the hominin line."</p>
    
    <p>Religion isn't just a set of beliefs—it's a direct connection to our earliest ancestors and the ways they made sense of a dangerous and beautiful world. It's a blueprint of collective human experience stretching back through time. In the words of sociologist Robert Bellah: "Nothing is ever lost."</p>
    
    <p>History goes all the way back. Who we are, how we are, and where we are now results from that history winding forward. Any human phenomenon that exists became what it is through this process. This is no less true of religion.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you find yourself drawn to the Newtonian framework, the Darwinian framework, or cycling between both, recognizing these two senses of truth opens up new ways of understanding human nature, culture, and survival itself.</p>
